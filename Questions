4.1.1 H(t) is the number of hosts that go uninfected throughout the year.
4.1.2 main():
          NB(24, 12, 2, 1, .056, 35)
          Both the host population and the parasite population have a steady
          decline before stagnating throughout the 35 years. Starting out very
          slow in the first few years and then flatlining. The parasite
          population dies out after 5 years.
4.1.3 main():
          NB(24, 12, 2, 1, -math.log(0.5) / paraPop, 35)
          Once again there is steady decline in both populations with a
          stagnation after a few years but the host population dropping lower than 7.
          the parasite population dies out again after 5 years.
4.1.4 main():
          NB(24, 12, 2, 1, .06, 35)
          Similar change in population with the host population dropping until
          it gets into a little lower than 7 hosts then stagnating. The parasite
          population dies after 5 years again.
4.1.5 The variable a can have drastic changes if the value of it is changed by
a large amount. In the three examples prior there is little change in the numbers
which cause a smaller change in the plots.
4.1.6 NB_CC(24, 12, 1.5, 1, .056, 40, 35)
      The graph takes a sharp decrease down and then goes back up before
      flatlining, both parasite and hosts do this.
4.1.7 The change in a has no effect here because of the carrying capacity of
the set of numbers we have chosen. The prior simulation did change because there
was no carrying capacity set to stop it.
